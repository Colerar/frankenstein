**point** | **String** | The part of the face relative to which the mask should be placed. One of “forehead”, “eyes”, “mouth”, or “chin”. | 
**x_shift** | **f32** | Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face size, from left to right. For example, choosing -1.0 will place mask just to the left of the default mask position. | 
**y_shift** | **f32** | Shift by Y-axis measured in heights of the mask scaled to the face size, from top to bottom. For example, 1.0 will place the mask just below the default mask position. |
